## Free Tier Limitations

This version is optimized for Render.com's free tier, which means:

1. **Sample Data**: The system uses sample job data instead of real-time scraping
2. **No Persistence**: Data resets when the service restarts
3. **Limited Resources**: The service may be slower and sleep after periods of inactivity

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Updates**: Run job searches manually by clicking "Run Now"
2. **CV Management**: Keep your CVs updated with your latest skills and experience
3. **Application Tracking**: Use the Applications page to follow up on your submissions
4. **Cover Letter Customization**: Always review and personalize generated cover letters
